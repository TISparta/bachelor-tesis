@book{LukasChrostowski2010,
abstract = {From design and simulation through to testing and fabrication, this hands-on introduction to silicon photonics engineering equips students with everything they need to begin creating foundry-ready designs. In-depth discussion of real-world issues and fabrication challenges ensures that students are fully equipped for careers in industry. Step-by-step tutorials, straightforward examples, and illustrative source code fragments guide students through every aspect of the design process, providing a practical framework for developing and refining key skills. Offering industry-ready expertise, the text supports existing PDKs for CMOS UV-lithography foundry services (OpSIS, ePIXfab, imec, LETI, IME and CMC) and the development of new kits for proprietary processes and clean-room based research. Accompanied by additional online resources to support students, this is the perfect learning package for senior undergraduate and graduate students studying silicon photonics design, and academic and industrial researchers involved in the development and manufacture of new silicon photonics systems.},

@article{Su2020,
abstract = {This paper presents a computational nanophotonic design library for gradient-based optimization called the Stanford Photonic INverse design Software (SPINS). Borrowing the concept of computational graphs, SPINS is a design framework that emphasizes flexibility and reproducible results. By factoring the inverse design process into components that can be swapped out for one another, SPINS enables inverse design practitioners to easily explore different design methodologies. Here, we present the mathematical and architectural details on how to achieve these goals, using the inverse design of a wavelength demultiplexer as a primary example. Using inverse design effectively requires understanding the "control knobs" available to the designer, and, to that end, we also discuss practical considerations and heuristics for effective use of inverse design. In particular, by running inverse design on hundreds of designs of 3D wavelength demultiplexers, this paper explores the landscape of local minima, which leads to insights on the choice of initial conditions.},

@article{Su2018,
abstract = {In wavelength division multiplexing schemes, splitters must be used to combine and separate different wavelengths. Conventional splitters are fairly large with footprints in hundreds to thousands of square microns, and experimentally demonstrated multimode-interference-based and inverse-designed ultracompact splitters operate with only two channels and large channel spacing (>100 nm). Here we inverse design and experimentally demonstrate a three-channel wavelength demultiplexer with 40 nm spacing (1500, 1540, and 1580 nm) with a footprint of 24.75 $\mu$m2. The splitter has a simulated peak insertion loss of -1.55 dB with under -15 dB crosstalk and a measured peak insertion loss of -2.29 dB with under -10.7 dB crosstalk.},

@article{Malheiros-Silveira2020,
abstract = {We adapted the standard artificial bee colony algorithm for a binary search space in order to optimize photonic structures. The artificial bee colony algorithm in conjunction with the finite element method is applied for maximizing photonic bandgaps of photonic crystals. The proposed approach is assessed by two case studies assuming 2D photonic crystals comprised of silicon and air in a triangular lattice. The crystals were optimized to present large photonic bandgaps. The artificial bee colony algorithm presented superior performance when compared with that of a standard genetic algorithm, demonstrating an interesting approach to be used on the inverse design or optimization of photonic structures.},
