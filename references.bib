abstract = {This paper presents a computational nanophotonic design library for gradient-based optimization called the Stanford Photonic INverse design Software (SPINS). Borrowing the concept of computational graphs, SPINS is a design framework that emphasizes flexibility and reproducible results. By factoring the inverse design process into components that can be swapped out for one another, SPINS enables inverse design practitioners to easily explore different design methodologies. Here, we present the mathematical and architectural details on how to achieve these goals, using the inverse design of a wavelength demultiplexer as a primary example. Using inverse design effectively requires understanding the "control knobs" available to the designer, and, to that end, we also discuss practical considerations and heuristics for effective use of inverse design. In particular, by running inverse design on hundreds of designs of 3D wavelength demultiplexers, this paper explores the landscape of local minima, which leads to insights on the choice of initial conditions.},

@article{Kudyshev2020,
abstract = {Over the past decade, artificially engineered optical materials and nanostructured thin films have revolutionized the area of photonics by employing novel concepts of metamaterials and metasurfaces where spatially varying structures yield tailorable "by design"effective electromagnetic properties. The current state-of-the-art approach to designing and optimizing such structures relies heavily on simplistic, intuitive shapes for their unit cells or metaatoms. Such an approach cannot provide the global solution to a complex optimization problem where metaatom shape, in-plane geometry, out-of-plane architecture, and constituent materials have to be properly chosen to yield the maximum performance. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-assisted global optimization framework for photonic metadevice design. We demonstrate that using an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) coupled with a metaheuristic optimization framework significantly enhances the optimization search efficiency of the metadevice configurations with complex topologies. We showcase the concept of physics-driven compressed design space engineering that introduces advanced regularization into the compressed space of an AAE based on the optical responses of the devices. Beyond the significant advancement of the global optimization schemes, our approach can assist in gaining comprehensive design "intuition"by revealing the underlying physics of the optical performance of metadevices with complex topologies and material compositions.},

This task has long been believed to be extremely difficult, with fear of local minima and other obstacles motivating a variety of schemes to improve optimization, such as unsupervised pretraining. However, modern neural networks are able to achieve negligible training error on complex tasks, using only direct training with stochastic gradient descent. We introduce a simple analysis technique to look for evidence that such networks are overcoming local optima.

abstract = {Nanophotonics, the field that merges photonics and nanotechnology, has in recent years revolutionized the field of optics by enabling the manipulation of light–matter interactions with subwavelength structures. However, despite the many advances in this field, the design, fabrication and characterization has remained widely an iterative process in which the designer guesses a structure and solves the Maxwell's equations for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., obtaining a geometry for a desired electromagnetic response, remains a challenging and time-consuming task within the boundaries of very specific assumptions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a novel Deep Neural Network trained with thousands of synthetic experiments is not only able to retrieve subwavelength dimensions from solely far-field measurements but is also capable of directly addressing the inverse problem. Our approach allows the rapid design and characterization of metasurface-based optical elements as well as optimal nanostructures for targeted chemicals and biomolecules, which are critical for sensing, imaging and integrated spectroscopy applications.},

abstract = {Numerical optimization is an important tool in the field of computational physics in general and in nano-optics in specific. It has attracted attention with the increase in complexity of structures that can be realized with current nanofabrication technologies for which a rational design is no longer feasible. Also, numerical resources are available to enable the computational photonic material design and to identify structures that meet predefined optical properties for specific applications. However, the optimization objective function is in general nonconvex and its computation remains resource demanding such that the right choice for the optimization method is crucial to obtain excellent results. Here, we benchmark five global optimization methods for three typical nano-optical optimization problems: particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and Bayesian optimization as well as multistart versions of downhill simplex optimization and the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. In the shown examples from the field of shape optimization and parameter reconstruction, Bayesian optimization, mainly known from machine learning applications, obtains significantly better results in a fraction of the run times of the other optimization methods.},

@article{Elsawy2020,
abstract = {In recent years, metasurfaces have emerged as revolutionary tools to manipulate the behavior of light at the nanoscale. These devices consist of nanostructures defined within a single layer of metal or dielectric materials, and they offer unprecedented control over the optical properties of light, leading to previously unattainable applications in flat lenses, holographic imaging, polarimetry, and emission control, amongst others. The operation principles of metaoptics include complex light–matter interactions, often involving insidious near-field coupling effects that are far from being described by classical ray optics calculations, making advanced numerical modeling a requirement in the design process. In this contribution, recent optimization techniques used in the inverse design of high performance metasurfaces are reviewed. These methods rely on the iterative optimization of a Figure of Merit to produce a final device, leading to freeform layouts featuring complex and non-intuitive properties. The concepts in numerical inverse designs discussed herein will push this exciting field toward realistic and practical applications, ranging from laser wavefront engineering to innovative facial recognition and motion detection devices, including augmented reality retro-reflectors and related complex light field engineering.},
