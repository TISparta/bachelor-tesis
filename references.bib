abstract = {This paper presents a computational nanophotonic design library for gradient-based optimization called the Stanford Photonic INverse design Software (SPINS). Borrowing the concept of computational graphs, SPINS is a design framework that emphasizes flexibility and reproducible results. By factoring the inverse design process into components that can be swapped out for one another, SPINS enables inverse design practitioners to easily explore different design methodologies. Here, we present the mathematical and architectural details on how to achieve these goals, using the inverse design of a wavelength demultiplexer as a primary example. Using inverse design effectively requires understanding the "control knobs" available to the designer, and, to that end, we also discuss practical considerations and heuristics for effective use of inverse design. In particular, by running inverse design on hundreds of designs of 3D wavelength demultiplexers, this paper explores the landscape of local minima, which leads to insights on the choice of initial conditions.},

@article{Kudyshev2020,
abstract = {Over the past decade, artificially engineered optical materials and nanostructured thin films have revolutionized the area of photonics by employing novel concepts of metamaterials and metasurfaces where spatially varying structures yield tailorable "by design"effective electromagnetic properties. The current state-of-the-art approach to designing and optimizing such structures relies heavily on simplistic, intuitive shapes for their unit cells or metaatoms. Such an approach cannot provide the global solution to a complex optimization problem where metaatom shape, in-plane geometry, out-of-plane architecture, and constituent materials have to be properly chosen to yield the maximum performance. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-assisted global optimization framework for photonic metadevice design. We demonstrate that using an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) coupled with a metaheuristic optimization framework significantly enhances the optimization search efficiency of the metadevice configurations with complex topologies. We showcase the concept of physics-driven compressed design space engineering that introduces advanced regularization into the compressed space of an AAE based on the optical responses of the devices. Beyond the significant advancement of the global optimization schemes, our approach can assist in gaining comprehensive design "intuition"by revealing the underlying physics of the optical performance of metadevices with complex topologies and material compositions.},

However, despite the many advances in this field, the design, fabrication and characterization has remained widely an iterative process in which the designer guesses a structure and solves the Maxwell's equations for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., obtaining a geometry for a desired electromagnetic response, remains a challenging and time-consuming task within the boundaries of very specific assumptions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a novel Deep Neural Network trained with thousands of synthetic experiments is not only able to retrieve subwavelength dimensions from solely far-field measurements but is also capable of directly addressing the inverse problem. Our approach allows the rapid design and characterization of metasurface-based optical elements as well as optimal nanostructures for targeted chemicals and biomolecules, which are critical for sensing, imaging and integrated spectroscopy applications.},

Also, numerical resources are available to enable the computational photonic material design and to identify structures that meet predefined optical properties for specific applications. However, the optimization objective function is in general nonconvex and its computation remains resource demanding such that the right choice for the optimization method is crucial to obtain excellent results. Here, we benchmark five global optimization methods for three typical nano-optical optimization problems: particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and Bayesian optimization as well as multistart versions of downhill simplex optimization and the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm.

These devices consist of nanostructures defined within a single layer of metal or dielectric materials, and they offer unprecedented control over the optical properties of light, leading to previously unattainable applications in flat lenses, holographic imaging, polarimetry, and emission control, amongst others. The operation principles of metaoptics include complex light–matter interactions, often involving insidious near-field coupling effects that are far from being described by classical ray optics calculations, making advanced numerical modeling a requirement in the design process. In this contribution, recent optimization techniques used in the inverse design of high performance metasurfaces are reviewed. These methods rely on the iterative optimization of a Figure of Merit to produce a final device, leading to freeform layouts featuring complex and non-intuitive properties.

@article{Zhang2021,
abstract = {Local-gradient-based optimization approaches lack nonlocal exploration ability required for escaping from local minima in non-convex landscapes. A directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was proposed in our recent work and used to define a truly nonlocal gradient, referred to as the DGS gradient, in order to enable nonlocal exploration in high-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that replacing the traditional local gradient with the nonlocal DGS gradient can significantly improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing highly multi-modal loss functions. However, the current DGS method is designed for unbounded and unconstrained optimization problems, making it inapplicable to real-world engineering design optimization problems where the tuning parameters are often bounded and the loss function is usually constrained by physical processes. In this work, we propose to extend the DGS approach to the constrained inverse design framework in order to find a better design. The proposed framework has its advantages in portability and flexibility to naturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation, and objective formulation together to build up an effective inverse design workflow. A series of adaptive strategies for smoothing radius and learning rate updating are developed to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. To enable a clear binarized design, a dynamic growth mechanism is imposed on the projection strength in parameterization. The methodology is demonstrated by an example of wavelength demultiplexer. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. By incorporating volume constraints, the optimized design achieves an equivalently high performance but significantly reduces the amount of material usage.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a powerful iterative inverse design technique in metasurface engineering and can transform an initial layout into a high-performance device. With this method, devices are optimized within a local design phase space, making the identification of suitable initial geometries essential. In this Letter, we examine the impact of initial geometric layout on the performance of large-angle (75\&\#x00A0;deg) topology-optimized metagrating deflectors. We find that when conventional metasurface designs based on dielectric nanoposts are used as initial layouts for topology optimization, the final devices have efficiencies around 65\%. In contrast, when random initial layouts are used, the final devices have ultra-high efficiencies that can reach 94\%. Our numerical experiments suggest that device topologies based on conventional metasurface designs may not be suitable to produce ultra-high-efficiency, large-angle metasurfaces. Rather, initial geometric layouts with non-trivial topologies and shapes are required.},

In fact, today optimization is no longer an afterthought and is a fundamental tool for many optical and RF designers. Still, many devices presented in recent literature do not take advantage of optimization techniques. This paper seeks to address this by presenting both an introduction to and a review of several of the most popular techniques currently used for meta-device design. Additionally, emerging techniques like topology optimization and multi-objective optimization and their context to device design are thoroughly discussed. Moreover, attention is given to future directions in meta-device optimization such as surrogate-modeling and deep learning which have the potential to disrupt the fields of optical and radio frequency (RF) inverse-design. Finally, many design examples from the literature are presented and a flow-chart that provides guidance on how best to apply these optimization algorithms to a given problem is provided for the reader.},

abstract = {We propose a general method for eliminating the reflection of waves in 2 dimensional photonic crystal waveguides (2D-PCWs), a kind of 2D material, by introducing extra scatterers inside the 2D-PCWs. The intrinsic reflection in 2D-PCWs is compensated by the backward-scattered waves from these scatterers, so that the overall reflection is greatly reduced and the insertion loss is improved accordingly. We first present the basic theory for the compensation method. Then, as a demonstration, we give four examples of extremely-low-reflection and high-transmission 90°bent 2D-PCWs created according to the method proposed. In the four examples, it is demonstrated by plane-wave expansion method and finite-difference time-domain method that the 90°bent 2D-PCWs can have high transmission ratio greater than 90% in a wide range of operating frequency, and the highest transmission ratio can be greater than 99.95% with a return loss higher than 43 dB, better than that in other typical 90°bent 2D-PCWs. With our method, the bent 2D-PCWs can be optimized to obtain high transmission ratio at different operating wavelengths. As a further application of this method, a waveguide-based optical bridge for light crossing is presented, showing an optimum return loss of 46.85 dB, transmission ratio of 99.95%, and isolation rates greater than 41.77 dB. The method proposed provides also a useful way for improving conventional waveguides made of cables, fibers, or metal walls in the optical, infrared, terahertz, and microwave bands.}

abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms for the design of engineering systems. This book offers a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.}

Approaches comprise gradient- and non-gradient-based algorithms combined with more or less systematic ways to improve convergence, discreteness of solutions, and satisfaction of manufacturing constraints. We here provide a tutorial for the systematic and efficient design of nano-photonic structures by TopOpt. The implementation is based on the advanced and systematic approaches developed in TopOpt for structural optimization during the last three decades. The tutorial presents a step-by-step guide for deriving the continuous constrained optimization problem forming the foundation of the TopOpt method, using a cylindrical metalens design problem as an example. It demonstrates the effect and necessity of applying a number of auxiliary tools in the design process to ensure good numerical modeling practice and to achieve physically realizable designs. Application examples also include an optical demultiplexer.},

abstract = {In the photonic design problem, a scientist or engineer chooses the physical parameters of a device to best match some desired device behavior. Many instances of the photonic design problem can be naturally stated as a mathematical optimization problem that is computationally difficult to solve globally. Because of this, several heuristic methods have been developed to approximately solve such problems. These methods often produce very good designs, and, in many practical applications, easily outperform \&\#x2018;traditional\&\#x2019; designs that rely on human intuition. Yet, because these heuristic methods do not guarantee that the approximate solution found is globally optimal, the question remains of just how much better a designer might hope to do. This question is addressed by performance bounds or impossibility results, which determine a performance level that no design can achieve. We focus on algorithmic performance bounds, which involve substantial computation to determine. We illustrate a variety of both heuristic methods and performance bounds on two examples. In these examples (and many others not reported here) the performance bounds show that the heuristic designs are nearly optimal, and can be considered globally optimal in practice. This review serves to clearly set up the photonic design problem and unify existing approaches for calculating performance bounds, while also providing some natural generalizations and properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Inspired by biological systems, swarm intelligence algorithms are widely used to solve multimodal optimization problems. In this study, we consider the hybridization problem of an algorithm based on the collective behavior of fish schools. The algorithm is computationally inexpensive compared to other population-based algorithms. Accuracy of fish school search increases with the increase of predefined iteration count, but this also affects computation time required to find a suboptimal solution. We propose two hybrid approaches, intending to improve the evolutionary-inspired algorithm accuracy by using classical optimization methods, such as gradient descent and Newton&rsquo;s optimization method. The study shows the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithms, and the strong advantage of the hybrid algorithm based on fish school search and gradient descent. We provide a solution for the linearly inseparable exclusive disjunction problem using the developed algorithm and a perceptron with one hidden layer. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms, we visualize high dimensional loss surfaces near global extreme points. In addition, we apply the distributed version of the most effective hybrid algorithm to the hyperparameter optimization problem of a neural network.},
